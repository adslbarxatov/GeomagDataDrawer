<p><em><strong>Geomag data drawer</strong></em> is a software tool designed to build diagrams based on tabular data. It was originally
created as a means of visualizing the results of experimental measurements; can still be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Geomag data drawer supports the following data formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>Microsoft Office Excel ’97 and ’07 spreadsheets</strong></em> (<code>.xls</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>). Support is provided through additional software.
The presence of the installed Microsoft Office software package is not required.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Tabular data in Windows CSV format</strong></em> (<code>.csv</code>; separators are semicolons).</li>
<li>In order to expand the capabilities of the app, the ability to <em><strong>extract data from files of text formats</strong></em> has also been added.</li>
<li>In addition, the app has its <em><strong>own data storage format</strong></em>, which includes both the diagram data itself,
as well as its style and display settings (Geomag data drawer files, <code>.gdd</code>).</li>
<li>The app can <em><strong>generate tabular data</strong></em> by running a given numerical range through analytically
given function. The function and plotting range can be manually specified by user.</li>
<li>Finally, it is possible to use <em><strong>text data from the clipboard</strong></em> for plotting.</li>
<li>Data file conversion from the command line is also available, which allows automatic (batch) processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of data visualization and processing, Geomag data drawer provides the following main features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction of diagrams according to the presented data.</li>
<li>Generation of data for plotting curves from an analytically given function.</li>
<li>Editing diagram data in the built-in editor.</li>
<li>Saving data files in Windows CSV format and as raw tabular data.</li>
<li>Customization of most of the graphic characteristics of diagrams: sizes, placement, colors, fonts, lines, markers, etc.</li>
<li>Setting your own coordinate plane and independent use of data columns as abscissas and ordinates for each dependence under study.</li>
<li>Adding additional graphic objects: text labels, rectangles, ellipses and lines.</li>
<li>Saving diagrams in graphic format <code>.png</code> with the ability to set a sufficiently large output size.
This allows you to overcome the limitations of raster graphics when further using the image.</li>
<li>Saving diagrams in vector formats <code>.svg</code> version 1.1 and <code>.emf</code>, if it is necessary to avoid losses
when inserting an image into a printed document, or additional editing of the generated diagram in a vector graphics editor is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation as a standalone application, support for all basic features for editing, building and designing diagrams, flexible
settings system, bilingual interface, as well as the ability to store data in its own format eliminates the need to install additional
software systems. Therefore, <em><strong>Geomag data drawer</strong></em> can be considered a very useful tool for processing and visualizing tabular data.</p>
