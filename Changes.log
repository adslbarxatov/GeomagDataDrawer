Geomag data drawer changes log

To do
• Fix scaled image saving when texts and notches are not automated

Version 4.13
• Fixed drawing of vector images in 'markers only' mode (lines will not draw anymore);
• Fixed color setting for filled shapes;
• Added ability to save an image from command line (PNG or SVG; uses default preview template)

Version 4.12
• Abscissa processing variables extended to 'double';
• Some improvements added to parsing functions;
• Fixed some minor bugs.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files ARE NOT compatible with previous version of application due to extension of styles' data fields

Version 4.11
• Formula evaluation interface updated: more freedom in formula input – all letter cases allowed, using and missing spaces allowed; exponential number format support removed;
• Data rows count limit adjusted for best fitness with curves generation ranges;
• Incorrect middle/center axes placement fixed;
• Application menu fully reviewed: curves merging, data columns replacing, styles management and preview templates have been moved to new menu item called 'Operations';
• Application interface reviewed: only adding, deleting, hiding and selection tools are now at the main window. Adding and deleting tools have been duplicated by hotkeys and now available from the keyboard.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application

Version 4.10
• ExcelDataReader was updated to actual version. Accidentally, it fixed some bugs in XLS files loading process;
• QuickSheet has been rewritten and now available in user manual (part 6).
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application

Version 4.9
• .any input file format has been removed; replaced with extracting option;
• .csv and .xls[x] formats parsing now more 'tolerant': invalid and text values will be replaced with zeros;
• Application can be used from command line for data file formats conversion; use /? key or user manual (part 4.5) for more information;
• QuickSheet has been removed from user manual; it will be rewritten soon.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application

Version 4.8
• Loading diagram data from the clipboard is now available (use Ctrl + V);
• Keys for data editor changed to Ctrl + E (it is more suitable);
• Added missing tool tips for main menu.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application

Version 4.7
• Curves generation interface upgraded: fixed potential 'division by zero' exception;
• Drawing interruption curves points and NaN values now works correctly.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application

Version 4.6
• Microsoft Excel format support added (file opening). Based on MIT license. Read user manual for more information.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application

Version 4.5c
• Some raster images drawing bugs fixed (invalid rectangles cropping, line's first marker absence);
• 'Usage tips' section added to help file.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application, but you may need to re-add 'line' objects to your diagram

Version 4.5
• Upgraded additional object 'line': endpoints coordinates setting has been simplified;
• Some minor defects have been fixed

Version 4.4
• Graphical shapes added; now user can seriously increase informativity of his diagrams by using free text labels, pointing lines, rectangles and ellipses (up to 50 in this version);
• Some picture saving bugs fixed;
• Axes notches count auto-evaluation has been revised;
• Curves merging bugs fixed;
• Configuration panels' behavior has been revised.
*.gdd and *.gddstyle files from old and new versions of application are compatible in both directions

Version 4.3
• Improved data table generation function. Now user can enter a SET of analytical representations of functions and set plotting range for them. And get a diagram with SET of curves as a result;
• Some artifacts in formula evaluation class fixed: speed of lexemes extraction seriously increased;
• Some other interface bugs fixed;
• Count of curves in diagram decreased from 100 to 20: don't think that it is necessary to have too many curves on a diagram.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application

Version 4.2
• Added data table generation function. Now user can enter analytical representation of function and set plotting range for it. And get a diagram as a result;
• Added 'Close diagram' function. Sometimes it is necessary;
• Some artifacts fixed.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application

Version 4.1
• EMF (Windows metafile) support added (saving diagrams) (compatible with Office applications);
• Curve drawing bug (incorrect displaying of curve's break) in vector image formats fixed (but it causes increasing of them sizes; EMZ and SVGZ will solve this problem).
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application

Version 4.0
• English (USA) variant of interface added; help file not translated yet;
• Internal dialogs have been updated and unified;
• Mouse placement of curve images bug fixed;
• Some artifacts fixed;
• Grid drawing updated and corrected;
• Data redundancy in DiagramData class fixed.
*.gdd and *.gddstyle from 3.8 are compatible with 4.0

Version 3.8
