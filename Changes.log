Geomag data drawer changes log

Version 3.8
• Publishing on GitHub.

Version 4.0
• English (USA) variant of interface added; help file not translated yet;
• Internal dialogs have been updated and unified;
• Mouse placement of curve images bug fixed;
• Some artifacts fixed;
• Grid drawing updated and corrected;
• Data redundancy in DiagramData class fixed.
*.gdd and *.gddstyle from 3.8 are compatible with 4.0.

Version 4.1
• EMF (Windows metafile) support added (saving diagrams) (compatible with Office applications);
• Curve drawing bug (incorrect displaying of curve's break) in vector image formats fixed (but
  it causes increasing of them sizes; EMZ and SVGZ will solve this problem).
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application.

Version 4.2
• Added data table generation function. Now user can enter analytical representation of function
  and set plotting range for it. And get a diagram as a result;
• Added 'Close diagram' function. Sometimes it is necessary;
• Some artifacts fixed.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application.

Version 4.3
• Improved data table generation function. Now user can enter a SET of analytical representations
  of functions and set plotting range for them. And get a diagram with SET of curves as a result;
• Some artifacts in formula evaluation class fixed: speed of lexemes extraction seriously increased;
• Some other interface bugs fixed;
• Count of curves in diagram decreased from 100 to 20: don't think that it is necessary to have too
  many curves on a diagram.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application.

Version 4.4
• Graphical shapes added; now user can seriously increase informativity of his diagrams by using
  free text labels, pointing lines, rectangles and ellipses (up to 50 in this version);
• Some picture saving bugs fixed;
• Axes notches count autoevaluation has been revised;
• Curves merging bugs fixed;
• Configuration panels behaviour has been revised.
*.gdd and *.gddstyle files from old and new versions of application are compatible in both directions.

Version 4.5
• Upgraded additional object 'line': endpoints coordinates setting has been simplifyed;
• Some minor defects have been fixed.
Sub-version 4.5c
• Some raster images drawing bugs fixed (invalid rectangles cropping, line's first marker absence);
• 'Usage tips' section added to help file.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application, but you may need
to re-add 'line' objects to your diagram.

Version 4.6
• Microsoft Excel format support added (file opening). Based on MIT license. Read user manual for more
  information.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application.

Version 4.7
• Curves generation interface upgraded: fixed potential 'division by zero' exception;
• Drawing of curve's interruption points and NaN values now works correctly.
New *.gdd and *.gddstyle files are compatible with previous version of application.
